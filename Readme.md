## BILLIARDS
> One of my favorite past times is meeting and playing with professional pool players. I've gotten the opportunity to get completely obliterated by some of the world's best players. Here's a video with professional player Alex Pagulayan filmed at Amsterdam Billiards in New York City. For some reason I can't actually embed a video here which is really surprising, but a quick search of the github website informed me that I could hyperlink a video with the thumbnail of the video pretty easily, so here's that.

## RESEARCH INTERESTS
> My absolute number-one-with-a-bullet Raison D'Ãªtre is to connect my obsession with climate change to my interest in comedic communication. Climate change sometimes suffers from a messaging problem and too many articulate idiots making bad faith arguments have done lasting damage to people in developing worlds because they refuse to believe in science. But if I had to talk about my research interests in a numbered list, it might look a little something like this:

1. The effect of ocean acificication on commercial tourism
2. Sea level rise vs economic growth
3. Climate change denial vs age, location, income, political affiliation
